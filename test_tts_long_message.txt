🎤 **TESTING TTS SYSTEM - MAXIMUM LENGTH DISCORD NITRO MESSAGE**

This is a comprehensive test message designed to push the Text-to-Speech system to its limits. At exactly 2000 characters, this message tests Discord Nitro maximum message length while evaluating how the TTS system handles long text, complex formatting, abbreviations like JKM, usernames like xXDarkLordXx, technical terms, emojis, and various punctuation.

**SECTION 1: TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY**
The system processes cryptographic hashes, implements O(1) complexity algorithms, uses OrderedDict for efficient LRU cache eviction, and handles asynchronous operations with asyncio event loops. We're testing HTTP/HTTPS connections, API endpoints, JSON serialization, and WebSocket protocols.

**SECTION 2: USERNAMES AND GAMERTAGS**
Various usernames include: Trolle, xXDarkLordXx, ProGamer99, EpicWin2024, MLGPro1337, NoobSlayer9000, and EliteWarrior88. These complex names should trigger the pronunciation improvement system to convert them into speakable forms.

**SECTION 3: ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS**
Common acronyms: API (Application Programming Interface), TTS (Text-to-Speech), LRU (Least Recently Used), HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), UI (User Interface), UX (User Experience), AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), NLP (Natural Language Processing).

**SECTION 4: MIXED CASE AND ALPHANUMERIC**
Testing patterns like: DiscordBot2024, OpenAIVoiceAPI, SecretSanta2025, WaveTechToolBox, Python3.12, FFmpeg4.2, OpusAudio64kbps, and various combinations that mix letters and numbers together.

**SECTION 5: PUNCTUATION AND FORMATTING**
Testing periods, exclamation marks, question marks, commas, semicolons, colons, dashes, parentheses, brackets, and quotes! Does it handle multiple sentences correctly? How about nested punctuation (like this)? Can it process "quoted text" and 'single quotes'?

**SECTION 6: NUMBERS AND DATES**
Important dates: December 30th, 2025; January 1st, 2024; The year 2023, and various timestamps like 1735689600. Numbers range from 0 to 999999, including decimals like 3.14159 and percentages like 99.9%.

**SECTION 7: SPECIAL CHARACTERS AND SYMBOLS**
Testing symbols: @mentions, #hashtags, $dollars, %percentages, &ampersands, *asterisks, +plus, -minus, =equals, <less, >greater, |pipes, \backslashes, /slashes, ~tildes, ^carets, {braces}, and [brackets].

**SECTION 8: MULTILINE CONTENT**
This section tests how the system handles line breaks, paragraph separations, and multiple newlines. Does it preserve natural pauses? Can it maintain readability across different formatting styles?

**SECTION 9: LONG WORDS AND COMPOUND TERMS**
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is an example, but we also test: pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, floccinaucinihilipilification, antidisestablishmentarianism, and other extraordinarily long words that challenge the TTS pronunciation engine.

**SECTION 10: FINAL CHECKS AND RANDOMNESS EXPLANATION**
The message should be processed completely, split into appropriate chunks if needed, maintain natural sentence boundaries, preserve meaning, handle all special cases, and produce high-quality audio output. If you can hear this entire message read clearly, the TTS system is working excellently! Randomness works using secrets.SystemRandom which sources from OS entropy pool for cryptographic security. Each Secret Santa shuffle produces different results while TTS voice assignment uses deterministic hash-based assignment for consistency. This ensures fair, unpredictable Secret Santa assignments while maintaining consistent voice per user in TTS sessions. The system retries up to max(10, participant_count) times with different random shuffles to find valid assignments that respect history constraints. This guarantees both randomness and fairness in Secret Santa pairings! 🎉🎵✨
